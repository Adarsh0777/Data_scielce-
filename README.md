Data Science and Machine Learning Projects on Real-World Datasets

This repository contains a collection of Data Science and Machine Learning projects where I worked on various real-world structured datasets. It demonstrates complete workflows including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, statistical analysis, and basic model building using Python.

About the Project

The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate the fundamental skills required for any Data Science or Machine Learning task — starting from handling raw data to making it ready for model building and deriving insights.

The project covers:
 • Data cleaning and transformation
 • Handling missing values and outliers
 • Encoding categorical variables
 • Feature scaling
 • Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
 • Feature engineering and selection
 • Hypothesis testing
 • Basic machine learning modeling and evaluation

Datasets Used
 • Electric Vehicle Population Data
 • Loan Data
 • Population by Marital Status, Gender, and Age
 • Titanic Dataset

These datasets cover diverse domains such as electric vehicle registration, loan risk analysis, population demographics, and survival prediction.

Techniques and Methods
 • Missing Value Imputation (SimpleImputer)
 • Outlier Detection and Treatment
 • One-Hot Encoding, Ordinal Encoding, Label Encoding
 • Feature Selection Techniques
 • Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Simulation
 • Hypothesis Testing
 • Polynomial Feature Engineering
 • Data Scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)
 • Basic Machine Learning Algorithms (Classification and Regression)

Libraries Used
 • pandas
 • numpy
 • scikit-learn
 • matplotlib
 • seaborn
 • scipy

Would you also like me to give you a small professional project title and one-line GitHub repository description you can set when creating the GitHub repo? (It makes the project look even more professional.)
Want me to suggest that too?
